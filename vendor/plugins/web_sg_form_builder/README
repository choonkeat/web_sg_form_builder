== QUICKSTART 
for the sake of seeing a demo / instruction page, this is the fastest way

1. cd $RAILS_ROOT
2. svn export http://choonkeat.svnrepository.com/svn/rails-plugins/web_sg_form_builder . --force
3. ./script/server
4. Go to http://localhost:3000/web_sg_form_builder

Feel free to edit app/views/web_sg_form_builder/index.rhtml and reload the URL mentioned above, to see the changes.

== INSTALL 
For proper usage - especially in Rails projects already under version control - you might wish to install only the plugin libraries:

1. cd $RAILS_ROOT
2. ./script/plugin install \
     http://choonkeat.svnrepository.com/svn/rails-plugins/web_sg_form_builder/vendor/plugins/web_sg_form_builder
